# TicTacToe

Welcome to TicTacToe, a classical two-player game implemented in Python. This project provides a command-line interface for playing the game on your terminal. Challenge your friend and see who can get three in a row!

## How to Play

The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Players take turns entering the row and column of the cell they want to mark with their symbol (X or O).
The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
